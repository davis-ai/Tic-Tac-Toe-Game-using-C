# Tic Tac Toe Game Using C
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game using C programming language.
The game is played between two players, X and O. The game board is a 3x3 matrix, and the players take turns marking a square on the board. The game ends when one player gets three in a row, column, or diagonal, or when all squares are filled and no player has won.
